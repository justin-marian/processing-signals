# üì° [FM Signal Processing with RTL-SDR](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/ps/labs/08)

---

## üìù Overview

This project focuses on processing **FM signals** captured using an **RTL-SDR** (Software Defined Radio) device or pre-recorded signals.  
The main tasks include **signal filtering, decimation, frequency demodulation, and audio extraction**.

### üéØ Objectives

- **Capture an FM signal** using an RTL-SDR device or a pre-recorded signal.
- **Filter the signal** using a **low-pass FIR filter** to remove unwanted frequencies.
- **Decimate the signal** to reduce the sampling rate while maintaining useful data.
- **Demodulate FM signals** using a simple frequency discriminator.
- **Extract and play audio** from the demodulated FM signal.
- **Analyze frequency components** using **Fourier Transform (FFT)**.
- **Save processed signals** and spectrograms for further analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts

---

### ‚úÖ Signal Capture (RTL-SDR)

- Captures raw **IQ samples** from an **RTL-SDR** tuner.
- Uses **librtlsdr** for tuning and receiving data.
- Saves the captured signal for later processing.

### ‚úÖ Spectrogram Analysis

- Computes and visualizes the **spectrogram** of the received **FM signal**.
- Displays how signal energy is distributed across different frequencies over time.

### ‚úÖ Signal Filtering

- Uses an **FIR low-pass filter** to remove unwanted frequencies.
- Applies a **Hamming window** to reduce spectral leakage.
- Plots the **filtered signal‚Äôs frequency spectrum**.

---

### ‚úÖ Signal Decimation

- Reduces the sampling rate to match the **FM signal bandwidth**.
- Improves computational efficiency while preserving key signal features.

---

### ‚úÖ FM Demodulation

- Implements **FM demodulation** using a **frequency discriminator**.
- Extracts the **baseband audio signal** from the FM carrier.
- Visualizes the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of the demodulated signal.

---

### ‚úÖ Audio Extraction & Playback

- Filters the **audio signal (0-15 kHz)** for **mono FM playback**.
- Decimates the audio signal to **44.1 kHz** for standard playback.
- Saves the extracted audio as a **WAV file** and plays it.

## üì¶ Installation & Requirements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install rtlsdr matplotlib scipy sounddevice numpy
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install RTL-SDR Drivers (if using an SDR device)

```bash
sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev  # üîπ Linux
brew install librtlsdr  # üîπMacOS (Homebrew)
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script

To process a **pre-recorded signal**, simply run:

```bash
python ex3.py
# To capture live **FM signals** using RTL-SDR, enable the SDR mode:
use_sdr: int = 1  # Change 0 to 1 in the script to enable SDR mode
```

### üéµ Playing Extracted Audio

Once the script runs successfully, it will play the **extracted audio**. You can also manually play the saved `.wav` file:

```bash
aplay x1.wav  # Linux/macOS
start x1.wav  # Windows
```

### üìÅ Output Files
