## üìå Signal Processing (SP) Labs  

This repository contains structured **Signal Processing (SP) labs**:
The labs focus on key concepts such as:  

- **Fourier Analysis:** Understanding frequency-domain representations of signals.  
- **DFT / FFT:** Computing and visualizing the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** and **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.  
- **Signal Filtering:** Implementing **low-pass, high-pass, band-pass FIR & IIR filters** to remove noise and extract useful components from the original signal.  
- **Convolution:** Applying convolution in **time-domain and frequency-domain** for system analysis and filtering.  
- **Windowing Methods:** Reducing spectral leakage using **Hanning, Hamming, Blackman** windows.  
- **Modulation Techniques:** Understanding and implementing **Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Phase Modulation (PM)** for communication systems.  
- **Spectral Leakage & Zero-Padding:** Investigating how **signal truncation** affects frequency domain analysis and how **zero-padding** improves resolution.  
- **FM Signal Processing with RTL-SDR:** Capturing, demodulating, and analyzing **real-world FM signals** using **Software Defined Radio (SDR)** techniques.  
- **Time & Frequency Shifting:** Learning how signals transform when shifted in **time and phase**.  
- **Digital Filtering in Python:** Designing **Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Kaiser filters** using **SciPy**.

## ‚ùì How to Run  

### üîé Example: Running `lab06`

In `lab06`, we analyze:

- the **effects of spectral leakage** in the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- experiment with **zero-padding** to improve frequency resolution.  

üîπ **Exercise 2 - DFT Leakage and Windowing**  

**Objective:**

- Load a signal containing two sinusoidal components.  
- Compute and plot the Fourier Transform.  
- Apply **Hanning windowing** to reduce spectral leakage.  
- Compare the results before and after applying the window function.  

üîπ **Running the Python Script:**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the `src/` directory of `lab06`:  

```bash
cd lab06/src
python ex2.py
```
